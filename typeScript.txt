    What is Typescript?
This is a programming language created to address the short-commings of javascript.
-Typescript is built on-top of javascript, so every javascript file is a valid typescript file.
-Typescript is javascript with type checking and additional features.
-Anything we can do with javascript, we can do with typescript.
    Banefit of typescript
1)Static typing: we set the type of our variable on declearation.
then we pass our code to the typescript compiler and the compiler will tell us if we are doing something wrong.
2)Code-completion.
3)Refactoring.
4)Shorthand notations.
    Draw-backs of typescript
1)Compilation: with typescript, there is always a compilation step invovled beacuse browsers don't understand typescript 
codes. so we have to give our code to a compiler to compile and translate it to javascript code. This process is called
TRANSPILATION.
2)Discipline in writing code: typescript is preferably used for medium to large projects while javascript is used for
small projects.
    How to install typescript
npm i -g typescript - This will install it globally on your computer.
tsc -v : check the version of typescript on your computer.
code . : to open vs code from your therminal.
ts : This is typescript extention file
    How to use compiler in typescript
'tsc filename' on your terminal after writing typescript code. It will compile and translate to javascript, 
creating a javascript extention.
    How to configure the typescript compiler
tsc --init : This creates a configuration file for the typescript compiler.
-in the 'target' : '2016' , you can clear the 2016 and press ctrl + space to see valid values to input.
-in module section (rootdir). it is advisible to put your rootdir into a 'src' folder, i.e './src'.
-in the Emit section (outdir), this is where our javascript file will be after compilation. it is advisible we put it in 
a 'dist' folder.
-if we also enable 'removeComment: true' all the comments in our typescript code will not be displayed in our jscode
-if we also enable "noEmitOnError": true", the javascript file will not be created when there's an error.
-After configuration, anytime we write a typescript code we just have to type only "tsc" on the terminal.
    How to debug typescript code
We go to the emit section in the tsconfig.json,
we enable the 'sourceMap: true': This feature is a file that specifies each line of our typescript code maps to the
generated javascript code.
-click on Run and debud
-click on create and launch a jsonfile
-select node.js
This creates a new file called launch.json
in the program and outfiles,
create a "preLaunchTask" : "tsc: build - tsconfig.json" in between the program and outfiles
This is telling vs code to build our application using this configuration.
After that click on debugging and launch program.
    Fundamentals
1)Built-in types
-javascript has built-in types like
numbers,boolean,string,null,undefined and objects.
-typescript extends this list to
any, unknown, never, enum, tuple.
-in typescript if you have a large number, you can seperate it digits using _
